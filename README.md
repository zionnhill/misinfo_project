## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting **misinformation on social media platforms** using machine learning.  
It is part of a cybersecurity initiative to help identify and reduce the spread of false or misleading information online.
target: elderly people

The project involves:
1. Collecting real-world social media datasets.
2. Processing and cleaning text data.
3. Extracting useful features such as text content and user behaviour.
4. Training and evaluating machine learning models.
5. Developing a simple web application to demonstrate model results.
